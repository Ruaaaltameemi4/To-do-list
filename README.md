"I created this To-Do List project using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to add interactive functionality.I started with a basic layout using a container <div> that holds the title, input box, button, and a list for tasks.
The HTML part defines the elements: an input field to enter new tasks, a button to add them, and an unordered list where tasks will appear.
I connected an external CSS file to style the layout, colors, and spacing.
The interactivity is done with JavaScript. When the 'Add' button is clicked, a function called addTask() is triggered. This function grabs the input value, creates a new list item (<li>), and adds it to the task list dynamically.
